## Use on public servers

I **DO NOT** support the use of this mod on any public servers which do not allow this kind of mod. The mod **does** work on servers but I do not approve of, and will not, support anyone that attempts to use thid mod on servers. I **do not** have the time to review each issue; I will simply close any issue with server connections in the crash log. 

If you wish to use this mod on private servers then that's on you. If you use this on public servers are banned then that's on you and I will **not** support your use of this mod in that way. 

## A note on Optifine
Currently, the mod does not and has not work with Optifine since MC `1.7.x`. I am not sure why the two mods do not work 
together and due to Optfine being closed source I don't have the ability to investigate it properly. For now, I just recommend not using the two mods together. I hope to have it fixed soon. 

## Supports

A quick note on versioning. I try to support everything I can but with limited time I opt to discontinue every version 2 versions below the current game version. Example: we're currently on 1.14.4 so I will support 1.14.4 and 1.12.2 ( we missed 1.13 ). If you find a very big bug in an old version I might be abe to resolve it if you submit a detailed bug report.

**Discontinued**: This means the mod is longer supported unless a game breaking bug is found.

**Limited support**: This means the mod will only receive bug fixes when ones are listed. I will no longer be back porting feature changes unless I get bored and have time to fix them.
